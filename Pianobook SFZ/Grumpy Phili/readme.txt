Grumpy Phili fafourites V1.1

* May 19 2022: Added Decent Sampler version

This is my Grumpy Philicorda! The first 'all tube' version of the Philips Philicorda organ that found its way into many Dutch households since the early sixties.

This one found its way into my studio some 20 years ago and was used on many recordings since. It sounds lovely and sometimes a little grumpy..

Sampling every sound of this organ is quite a lot and that's why I've kept it to 5 presets I called 'favourites'. There's only EXS and Decent Sampler formats for now and the different presets can be switched with the modulation controller on EXS. 
Also on EXS LFO1 is set to 6Hz so adding some vibrato simulates the original Philicorda vibrato!

As this model doesn't have the built in speakers, I recorded it straight into my RME ff800 interface.

Have fun playing this piece of history,
