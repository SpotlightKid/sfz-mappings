## Included formats

- Decent Sampler

## Release notes

This sampled instrument is based on a pianet T. This is a reed based instruemnt, I have added controls for LFO on the amp volume to create a tremolo effect
similar to the Wurlitzer piano. The chorus, delay and reverb can create some dreamy scapes.  

## Bug Fixes

## Using the instrument


When adding effect the volume can get loud, so care is neededto ensure the volume does not become too much. 
I have created a demo on youtube.com/channel/UCvApHOTJ8SyWToIs4WC_SpA
