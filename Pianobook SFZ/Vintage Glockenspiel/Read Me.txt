This is a Vintage Glockenspiel I've had laying around for a very long time.
But due to its dilapidated nature it hasn't been used much.
It's pretty much unplayable as an instrument,
as the frame work is not solid and only a handful of notes work depending on how you position it.

Sampled each note in the key of C and entered into Kontakt.
It has two velocity layers and a round robin count of a grand-2

This is my first foray into "proper" sampling, so I do hope you will find it fun.

I used Kontakt 5 as I know a lot of people may have not taken the plunge to 6 yet.


All the best.

Carl.
