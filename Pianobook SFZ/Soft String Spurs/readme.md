SFZ mapping for Soft String Spurs. Use these mappings with Sforzando. Original EXS24 library programming & samples by Dan Keen with additional
Kontakt programming by Angus Roberts Carey. https://www.pianobook.co.uk/library/soft-string-spurs/

This SFZ version mapping was created by kinwie. 

### How to use

- Download the Kontakt version of Soft String Spurs (created by Angus Roberts Carey): https://www.pianobook.co.uk/library/soft-string-spurs/

- Download the .sfz mapping and place it next to (not into) the "Samples" directory 

- Load in Sforzando.

Note:

The SFZ version is slightly different from the original EXS and Kontakt versions. It doesn't use crossfades or any scripting that is contained in the original versions, but it's still quite playable. 

The dynamics layers switching is using Mod wheel (cc1) with additional common Volume Expression cc11.
No velocity switching version. Volume for layers control, follow the kontakt version : Harmonics, Swells, Soft Longs and Hard Longs

There's possibly noticeable click on some samples.
