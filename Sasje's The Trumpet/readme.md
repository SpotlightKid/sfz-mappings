SFZ mapping for Sasje's The Trumpet. Use this mapping with Sforzando. Original Kontakt library, mapping and samples by Sasje.
This SFZ mapping was created by kinwie. 

### How to use

Download the original Sasje The Trumpet Kontakt library: https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=128677
Download the .sfz mapping and place it next to (not into) the "samples" folder of the original library.
Load in Sforzando.

Since trumpet is monophonic, sustain pedal cc (64) is turned off and used as Legato on/off.
There is also a macro for more user-friendly and flexible choosing of desired Midi CC.
For example: the AHDSR cc is not using standard cc but start from cc #80 so they are more well-arranged on the generic Sforzando panel

### Dedication

The Trumpet was created and shared by Sasje on the Cockos forum in 2013. In memory of Sasje whose health was deteriorating when he shared
his creations, we provide this free mapping for use with Sforzando. This was Sasje's original message back in 2013:

*Hello everyone, I thought about sharing my work. I've been creating Kontakt instruments for quite a while and I released them all for free. Since they aren't well known, 
I'd like to share them with you here. Some of the instruments uses open-source samples, and some I recorded myself. I hope you'll enjoy them.
Although some were created in Kontakt 4, many of them only work in Kontakt 5. My Mediafire account is only valid until December 2013 so be sure to get them all before they are gone. 
My health is seriously deteriorating and I won't be able to create something new or maintain them. Do what you want with them, as long as you don't sell them*
